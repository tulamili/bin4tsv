INSTALL memo for "bin4tsv" : 

1. Probably nothing, hopefully.

  -- Because the author's intention is that this module can be used at any institutions on the earth,
     including any government of any country as well as any company that may use old systems. 

  -- The author reuquires Perl 5.14 (published 2011-05-14; just around 10 years ago as of the author is writinet this document.)

2. But "Pod::Pod-PerldocJp" is recommendable to install because then the "perldoc" can show you the Japanese characters that 
   might be provided in each command line program which is provided by this "bin4tsv" module.
